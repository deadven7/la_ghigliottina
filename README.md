# Solving La Ghigliottina via Natural Language Processing

## Project Overview

"Solving La Ghigliottina" is an ambitious project that aims to decode the complex word association puzzles featured in the Italian game show "La Ghigliottina". By employing cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models like Skip-Gram, LSTM, T5, and BART, this project seeks to explore and enhance the understanding of language models in real-world applications.

## Key Features

- **Advanced NLP Techniques:** Utilizes models to decipher intricate word relationships and predict associations.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Incorporates several ML models to analyze and predict data more accurately.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Provides valuable insights that could potentially enhance future NLP applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for programming.
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch** for neural networks.
- **NLTK** for processing text data.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model development and visualization.

## Models and Methodology

The methodology revolves around the use of:
- **Skip-Gram:** To predict the context for a given word within a certain range.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Helps in retaining information for long periods in the model, which is crucial for understanding the sequence of words.
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):** Adapts text inputs into meaningful outputs, which is essential for this project.
- **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers):** Provides high-quality results in text generation tasks.

## Results and Evaluation

The models demonstrated varying levels of efficacy, with T5 and BART showing promising results in generating accurate word associations. These results were quantified using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, indicating significant potential for further refinement.

## Challenges Faced

- **Complexity of Language:** The project faced challenges related to the inherent complexities of natural languages, where multiple meanings and contexts had to be accurately interpreted by the models.
- **Data Limitations:** Curating a dataset that accurately represents the diverse nature of language and its nuances was a significant hurdle.

## Conclusions and Future Work

While the project has not completely solved the puzzles of "La Ghigliottina", it has laid a robust foundation for further research into the application of NLP in understanding and solving word association tasks. Future work can include enhancing the dataset, integrating more complex models, and expanding the scope to other languages and formats.
